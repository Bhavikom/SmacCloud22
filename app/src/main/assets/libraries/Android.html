      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br/>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br/>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br/>

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br/>

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br/>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br/>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br/>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br/>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br/>

      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>
      meet the following conditions:<br/>
	  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/>

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>
          the Derivative Works; and<br/>

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>

          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>
          as modifying the License.<br/>

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>

      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>

      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br/>
					   
</p>
<p style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</p>
<p style="background-color:whitesmoke;text-align:center;">
Preamble
</p>
<p style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
	software and other kinds of works.<br/>
	
	The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br/>
	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br/>
	the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br/>
	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br/>
	software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br/>
	GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br/>
	any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br/>
	your programs, too.<br/>
	
	When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br/>
	them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br/>
	want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br/>
	free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
	
	To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br/>
	these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br/>
	certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br/>
	you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br/>
	
	For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>
	gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br/>
	freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br/>
	or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br/>
	know their rights.<br/>
	
	Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br/>
	(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br/>
	giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br/>
	
	For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br/>
	that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br/>
	authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br/>
	changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br/>
	authors of previous versions.<br/>
	
	Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br/>
	modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br/>
	can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br/>
	protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br/>
	pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br/>
	use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br/>
	have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br/>
	products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br/>
	stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br/>
	of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br/>
	
	Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br/>
	States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br/>
	software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br/>
	avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br/>
	make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br/>
	patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br/>
	
	The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.<br/>

<p style="background-color:whitesmoke;text-align:center;">
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>
<p style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
0. Definitions.<br/>
	
	"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/>
	
	"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>
	works, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
	
	"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br/>
	License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br/>
	"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br/>
	
	To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br/>
	in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br/>
	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br/>
	earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br/>
	
	A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br/>
	on the Program.<br/>
	
	To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br/>
	permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br/>
	infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br/>
	computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br/>
	distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br/>
	public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
	
	To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br/>
	parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br/>
	a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
	
	An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br/>
	to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br/>
	feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br/>
	tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br/>
	extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br/>
	work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br/>
	the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br/>
	menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/>
	
	1. Source Code.<br/>
	
	The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br/>
	for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br/>
	form of a work.<br/>
	
	A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br/>
	standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br/>
	interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br/>
	is widely used among developers working in that language.<br/>
	
	The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br/>
	than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br/>
	packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br/>
	Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br/>
	Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br/>
	implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br/>
	"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br/>
	(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br/>
	(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br/>
	produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br/>
	
	The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br/>
	the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br/>
	work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br/>
	control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br/>
	System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br/>
	programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br/>
	which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br/>
	includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br/>
	the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br/>
	linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br/>
	such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br/>
	subprograms and other parts of the work.<br/>
	
	The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br/>
	can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br/>
	Source.<br/>
	
	The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br/>
	same work.<br/>
	
	2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
	
	All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br/>
	copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br/>
	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br/>
	permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br/>
	covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br/>
	content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br/>
	rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/>
	
	You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br/>
	convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br/>
	in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br/>
	of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br/>
	with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br/>
	the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br/>
	not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br/>
	for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br/>
	and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br/>
	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br/>
	
	Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br/>
	the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br/>
	makes it unnecessary.<br/>
	
	3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/>
	
	No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br/>
	measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br/>
	11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br/>
	similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br/>
	measures.<br/>
	
	When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br/>
	circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br/>
	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br/>
	the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br/>
	modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br/>
	users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br/>
	technological measures.<br/>
	
	4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/>
	
	You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br/>
	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br/>
	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br/>
	keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br/>
	non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br/>
	keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br/>
	recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br/>
	
	You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br/>
	and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br/>
	
	5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br/>
	
	You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br/>
	produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br/>
	terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
	
		a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br/>
		it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
	
		b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br/>
		released under this License and any conditions added under section<br/>
		7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br/>
		"keep intact all notices".<br/>
	
		c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br/>
		License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br/>
		License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br/>
		additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br/>
		regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br/>
		permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br/>
		invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
	
		d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br/>
		Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br/>
		interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br/>
		work need not make them do so.<br/>
	
	A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br/>
	works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br/>
	and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br/>
	in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br/>
	"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br/>
	used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br/>
	beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br/>
	in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br/>
	parts of the aggregate.<br/>
	
	6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br/>
	
	You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br/>
	of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br/>
	machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br/>
	in one of these ways:<br/>
	
		a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>
		(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br/>
		Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br/>
		customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
	
		b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>
		(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br/>
		written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br/>
		long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br/>
		model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br/>
		copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br/>
		product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br/>
		medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br/>
		more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br/>
		conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br/>
		Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br/>
	
		c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br/>
		written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br/>
		alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br/>
		only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br/>
		with subsection 6b.<br/>
	
		d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br/>
		place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br/>
		Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br/>
		further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br/>
		Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br/>
		copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br/>
		may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br/>
		that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br/>
		clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br/>
		Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br/>
		Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br/>
		available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br/>
	
		e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br/>
		you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br/>
		Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br/>
		charge under subsection 6d.<br/>
	
	A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br/>
	from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br/>
	included in conveying the object code work.<br/>
	
	A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br/>
	tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br/>
	or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br/>
	into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br/>
	doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br/>
	product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br/>
	typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br/>
	of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br/>
	actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br/>
	is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br/>
	commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br/>
	the only significant mode of use of the product.<br/>
	
	"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br/>
	procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br/>
	and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br/>
	a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br/>
	suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br/>
	code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br/>
	modification has been made.<br/>
	
	If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br/>
	specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br/>
	part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br/>
	User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br/>
	fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br/>
	Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br/>
	by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br/>
	if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br/>
	modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br/>
	been installed in ROM).<br/>
	
	The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br/>
	requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br/>
	for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br/>
	the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br/>
	network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br/>
	adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br/>
	protocols for communication across the network.<br/>
	
	Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br/>
	in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br/>
	documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br/>
	source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br/>
	unpacking, reading or copying.<br/>
	
	7. Additional Terms.<br/>
	
	"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br/>
	License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br/>
	Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br/>
	be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br/>
	that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br/>
	apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br/>
	under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br/>
	this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
	
	When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br/>
	remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br/>
	it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br/>
	removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br/>
	additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br/>
	for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br/>
	
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br/>
	add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br/>
	that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br/>
	
		a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br/>
		terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br/>
	
		b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br/>
		author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br/>
		Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br/>
	
		c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br/>
		requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br/>
		reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br/>
	
		d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br/>
		authors of the material; or<br/>
	
		e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br/>
		trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br/>
	
		f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br/>
		material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br/>
		it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br/>
		any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br/>
		those licensors and authors.<br/>
	
	All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br/>
	restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br/>
	received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br/>
	governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br/>
	restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br/>
	a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br/>
	License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br/>
	of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br/>
	not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
	
	If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br/>
	must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br/>
	additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br/>
	where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
	
	Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br/>
	form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br/>
	the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
	
	8. Termination.<br/>
	
	You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br/>
	provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br/>
	modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br/>
	this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br/>
	paragraph of section 11).<br/>
	
	However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br/>
	license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br/>
	provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br/>
	finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br/>
	holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br/>
	prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
	
	Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br/>
	reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br/>
	violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br/>
	received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br/>
	copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>
	your receipt of the notice.<br/>
	
	Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br/>
	licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br/>
	this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br/>
	reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br/>
	material under section 10.<br/>
	
	9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/>
	
	You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br/>
	run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br/>
	occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br/>
	to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br/>
	nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br/>
	modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br/>
	not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br/>
	covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br/>
	
	10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
	
	Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br/>
	receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br/>
	propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br/>
	for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
	
	An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br/>
	organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br/>
	organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br/>
	work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br/>
	transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br/>
	licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br/>
	give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br/>
	Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br/>
	the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
	
	You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br/>
	rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br/>
	not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br/>
	rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br/>
	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br/>
	any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br/>
	sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br/>
	
	11. Patents.<br/>
	
	A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br/>
	License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br/>
	work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br/>
	
	A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br/>
	owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br/>
	hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br/>
	by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br/>
	but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br/>
	consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br/>
	purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br/>
	patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br/>
	this License.<br/>
	
	Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br/>
	patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br/>
	make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br/>
	propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
	
	In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br/>
	agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br/>
	(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br/>
	sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br/>
	party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br/>
	patent against the party.<br/>
	
	If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br/>
	and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br/>
	to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br/>
	publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br/>
	then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br/>
	available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br/>
	patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br/>
	consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br/>
	license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br/>
	actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br/>
	covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br/>
	in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br/>
	country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
	
	If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br/>
	arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br/>
	covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br/>
	receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br/>
	or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br/>
	you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br/>
	work and works based on it.<br/>
	
	A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br/>
	the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br/>
	conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br/>
	specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br/>
	work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br/>
	in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br/>
	to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br/>
	the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br/>
	parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br/>
	patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br/>
	conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br/>
	for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br/>
	contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br/>
	or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
	
	Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br/>
	any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br/>
	otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br/>
	
	12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br/>
	
	If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br/>
	covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br/>
	not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br/>
	to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br/>
	the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br/>
	License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/>
	
	13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br/>
	
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br/>
	permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br/>
	under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br/>
	combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br/>
	License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br/>
	but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br/>
	section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br/>
	combination as such.<br/>
	
	14. Revised Versions of this License.<br/>
	
	The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br/>
	the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br/>
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>
	address new problems or concerns.<br/>
	
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br/>
	Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br/>
	Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br/>
	option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br/>
	version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br/>
	Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br/>
	GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br/>
	by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
	
	If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br/>
	versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br/>
	public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br/>
	to choose that version for the Program.<br/>
	
	Later license versions may give you additional or different<br/>
	permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br/>
	author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br/>
	later version.<br/>
	
	15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/>
	
	THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br/>
	APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br/>
	HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br/>
	OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br/>
	THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>
	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
	IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br/>
	ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
	
	16. Limitation of Liability.<br/>
	
	IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br/>
	THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br/>
	GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br/>
	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br/>
	DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br/>
	PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br/>
	EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>
	SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
	
	17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br/>
	
	If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br/>
	above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br/>
	reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br/>
	an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br/>
	Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br/>
	copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br/>
	
						END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
	
				How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
	
	If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>
	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
	
	To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br/>
	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br/>
	state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>
	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
	
		<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br/>
		Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br/>
	
		This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>
		it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br/>
		the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>
		(at your option) any later version.<br/>
	
		This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>
		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>
		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br/>
		GNU General Public License for more details.<br/>
	
		You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br/>
		along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br/>
	
	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
	
	If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br/>
	notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br/>
	
		<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author><br/>
		This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br/>
		This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>
		under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br/>
	
	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br/>
	parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br/>
	might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br/>
	
	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br/>
	if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br/>
	For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br/>
	<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br/>
	
	The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br/>
	into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br/>
	may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br/>
	the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br/>
	Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br/>
	<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

<p style="background-color:whitesmoke;">
"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<br/>
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br/>

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br/>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br/>

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br/>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br/>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br/>
